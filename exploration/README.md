# A2A Protocol & Agent Development Kit Exploration

## Overview
This document tracks the exploration of:
1. **A2A Protocol** - Agent-to-Agent communication protocol
2. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** - Google's framework for building AI agents
3. **Multi-Agent Systems** - ADK's approach to agent coordination
4. **Streaming Capabilities** - Real-time agent communication

## Key Discoveries

### A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent)
- **Purpose**: Enables communication between opaque agentic applications
- **Core Problem**: AI agents built on different frameworks need to collaborate
- **Solution**: Standardized protocol for agent discovery and communication

### Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Purpose**: Google's framework for building AI agents
- **Key Features**: Multi-agent orchestration, tool ecosystem, deployment ready
- **Architecture**: Flexible agent types and coordination patterns
